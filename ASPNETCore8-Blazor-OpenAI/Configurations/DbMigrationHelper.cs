wasn't a success\r\n0:19\r\nthis is going to be a fun one to unpack\r\n0:21\r\nbecause while that NSX sits there\r\n0:23\r\nlooking all timelessly beautiful\r\n0:25\r\npossessing zero engineering problems\r\n0:28\r\nhandling vices or personality flaws it\r\n0:30\r\nwound up being largely ignored by the\r\n0:33\r\nbuyers for whom it was created so did\r\n0:37\r\nHonda actually make a mistake or is\r\n0:39\r\nthere something the buyers missed\r\n0:44\r\n[Music]\r\n0:51\r\nthank you\r\n0:54\r\n[Music]\r\n0:57\r\nRevelations is brought to you by Hagerty\r\n0:59\r\nDrivers Club which includes roadside\r\n1:00\r\nassistance a fabulous magazine and\r\n1:02\r\ndiscounts on your favorite car stuff\r\n1:03\r\nthere's a link up there\r\n1:05\r\nclick on it thank you for watching and\r\n1:07\r\nnow back to my regularly scheduled\r\n1:09\r\nnonsense\r\n1:11\r\nHonda is a company that doesn't make\r\n1:14\r\nmistakes when it sets about\r\n1:15\r\naccomplishing something it Nails it post\r\n1:18\r\nhaste think about this for a second just\r\n1:21\r\nthree months after Honda debuts its\r\n1:24\r\nfirst ever car it says hey we're gonna\r\n1:26\r\ngo racing but not just any kind of\r\n1:28\r\nracing Formula One\r\n1:32\r\njust eight months later Honda made its\r\n1:35\r\nF1 debut when everyone else was using\r\n1:38\r\npiddly old V8s Honda built itself a 14\r\n1:41\r\n000 RPM 48 valve roller bearing crank\r\n1:44\r\nV12 and widely considered to be the most\r\n1:47\r\npowerful engine of the field\r\n1:50\r\nthe debut wasn't just at any old track\r\n1:54\r\nit was at the torturous Nurburgring so\r\n1:57\r\nyou'd expect Calamity but the Honda\r\n2:00\r\nwound up being classified a very\r\n2:02\r\nadmirable 13th overall after it crashed\r\n2:04\r\nout and it only took Honda another year\r\n2:07\r\nto win a Formula One race which means in\r\n2:10\r\na period of just two years Honda went\r\n2:13\r\nfrom making its first ever car to\r\n2:16\r\nwinning a Formula One race\r\n2:18\r\nyou're probably still wearing the same\r\n2:20\r\nunderwear that you were two years ago\r\n2:23\r\nme too this is a company that succeeded\r\n2:27\r\nat everything and only 20 some years\r\n2:29\r\nlater Honda was on top of the world its\r\n2:32\r\nluxury brand Acura launched in 1986 with\r\n2:34\r\nthe legendary Legend in 1989 the Accord\r\n2:37\r\nbecame the best-selling car in America\r\n2:39\r\nHonda was killing it on the racing side\r\n2:42\r\ntoo it had just returned to F1 in 1984\r\n2:45\r\nbut a Honda engine car won the Formula\r\n2:47\r\nOne Championship in 1986 1987 1988 1989\r\n2:53\r\n1990 and 1991.\r\n2:57\r\ncomprehensively defecating on the likes\r\n3:00\r\nof Ferrari and as this was all Brewing\r\n3:02\r\nHonda wanted a way to show off its\r\n3:04\r\nformula one technology on the street\r\n3:07\r\nand or just wanted to all over\r\n3:09\r\nFerrari on the boulevard too\r\n3:11\r\ndidn't just step on Ferrari's toes no it\r\n3:15\r\nkicked the Italians right in the groin\r\n3:17\r\nwhen it called up Ferrari's de facto\r\n3:19\r\nstyling house pin and Farina and said uh\r\n3:21\r\nhey forget about those guys for a second\r\n3:23\r\nhow about you design us an aerodynamic\r\n3:26\r\ncarbon composite sports car thing of the\r\n3:28\r\nfuture with our 2-liter V6 in the middle\r\n3:32\r\nthe nerve anyway the engine would have\r\n3:35\r\nto be in the middle because a formula\r\n3:37\r\none but also B Honda's Engineers had\r\n3:40\r\nexperimented by mounting the engine in\r\n3:42\r\nthe middle under the floor of the\r\n3:44\r\nsubcompact first generation Honda City\r\n3:45\r\nhatchback and they couldn't stop\r\n3:48\r\ngiggling\r\n3:49\r\nthe concept was called the HP hyphen X\r\n3:52\r\nfor Honda pin and Farina experimental\r\n3:55\r\nand it kicked off the development of the\r\n3:57\r\nNS hyphen X the new sports car X this\r\n4:01\r\ntime x stood for the mathematical X I.E\r\n4:04\r\nthe unknown there were no historical\r\n4:07\r\nconstraints because Honda had no history\r\n4:09\r\nfrom which to pull so the engineers had\r\n4:12\r\nfree reign to do whatever they needed\r\n4:13\r\nthe only goals were a top speed of 270\r\n4:16\r\nkilometers an hour quarter mile and less\r\n4:18\r\nthan 14 seconds and handling and braking\r\n4:21\r\nequal to any Ferrari or Porsche oh and\r\n4:24\r\none other thing the car had to be\r\n4:26\r\npractical and user friendly at the same\r\n4:28\r\ntime\r\n4:29\r\nbecause Honda\r\n4:30\r\nthe ideals of Formula One would carry\r\n4:33\r\nover meaning lightweight takes priority\r\n4:35\r\nover everything else and there would be\r\n4:37\r\nno gimmicks styling or otherwise the\r\n4:40\r\nconcepts composite construction was\r\n4:42\r\nreplaced by the world's first aluminum\r\n4:44\r\nmonocoque production car the same basic\r\n4:46\r\nconstruction method as Honda's first F1\r\n4:48\r\ncar\r\n4:49\r\nHonda used the world's fastest\r\n4:51\r\nsupercomputer the cray 2 to make the\r\n4:54\r\nnsx's chassis as stiff as possible but\r\n4:56\r\nthen hand it over keys to world champion\r\n4:58\r\nI hurt and Senna who disagreed with the\r\n5:01\r\ncomputers and said\r\n5:03\r\num\r\n5:04\r\nit's a little fragile\r\n5:06\r\nremember Honda doesn't fail so it pulled\r\n5:09\r\nout all the stops and set up shop two\r\n5:11\r\nkilometers away from the Nurburgring the\r\n5:13\r\nsite of that first ever F1 race just 25\r\n5:15\r\nyears earlier it used the ring to\r\n5:18\r\ntorture test the NSX with Japan's first\r\n5:21\r\never Formula One racer at the wheel\r\n5:23\r\nanytime he'd notice a structural\r\n5:25\r\nweakness the team would manually weld on\r\n5:28\r\nreinforcements until they fixed it and\r\n5:30\r\nthey'd send that information back to\r\n5:32\r\nJapan to be fed into the cray\r\n5:34\r\nsupercomputer which would then find a\r\n5:36\r\nlightweight solution to that structural\r\n5:38\r\nenhancement it's pretty cool\r\n5:41\r\nthe result of the Nurburgring project\r\n5:43\r\nwas a 50 increase in rigidity from the\r\n5:46\r\noriginal design making it by the way 50\r\n5:49\r\nstronger than that of a Porsche 911 or\r\n5:52\r\nFerrari 328\r\n5:53\r\nmore importantly thanks to the craze\r\n5:56\r\noptimization the whole aluminum body\r\n5:58\r\nshell weighed just 20 pounds more than\r\n6:00\r\nthe little tiny steel-bodied Miata that\r\n6:04\r\nMazda was developing at the same time to\r\n6:07\r\nmove the lightweight Wonder Honda tried\r\n6:08\r\na 5-liter V8 but it didn't meet the\r\n6:11\r\nstrict packaging and weight requirements\r\n6:13\r\nthen they tried turbocharged v6s but\r\n6:17\r\nturbos just never respond quickly or\r\n6:20\r\nlinearly enough for a sports car they\r\n6:22\r\ncould have made the power using a\r\n6:23\r\nsupercharger but superchargers weigh too\r\n6:26\r\nmuch\r\n6:29\r\nrevs the NSX inherited the c-series V6\r\n6:32\r\nto 6 that just launched in the Acura\r\n6:34\r\nLegend it was punched out to 3 liters\r\n6:36\r\nand made 250 horsepower by revving to a\r\n6:39\r\nhealthy 7300 RPM this was demonstrated\r\n6:43\r\nby Honda CEO as he banged the Prototype\r\n6:45\r\noff its rev limiter before its public\r\n6:47\r\ndebut at the Chicago Auto Show while\r\n6:50\r\nFord was in the room next door trying to\r\n6:52\r\nhold a press conference\r\n6:55\r\nand this accomplished two things well\r\n6:57\r\nthree because it's certainly pissed for\r\n6:59\r\nit off but number one it made sure that\r\n7:01\r\nevery journalist in town was in the room\r\n7:03\r\nthe next day when they pulled the wraps\r\n7:05\r\noff the NSX number two it prompted the\r\n7:08\r\nbig Honda boss to ask the question where\r\n7:10\r\nis the VTEC\r\n7:12\r\nthis was a huge Omission VTEC had\r\n7:16\r\npreviously only been planned for Honda's\r\n7:18\r\nfour cylinders but not for the V6 which\r\n7:20\r\nused only a single overhead cam per Bank\r\n7:23\r\nVTEC is often misunderstood but in\r\n7:25\r\nsimple terms it allows an engine to\r\n7:27\r\neffectively have two different sets of\r\n7:29\r\ncamshafts one that's tuned for the\r\n7:31\r\nbottom of the Rev range and another for\r\n7:33\r\nthe top of the Rev range VTEC simply\r\n7:35\r\nswitches between the two camshafts and\r\n7:37\r\nits benefits everywhere with absolutely\r\n7:39\r\nno drawbacks it's typical Honda reliable\r\n7:44\r\ngenius and the boss man wanted to know\r\n7:46\r\nwhy Honda's Flagship didn't have it\r\n7:50\r\nI think that's a reasonable question\r\n7:53\r\nso the flagship got VTEC and vvis and\r\n7:59\r\nthe V6 got something that no other Honda\r\n8:01\r\nV6 got until 2021 more than 30 years\r\n8:04\r\nlater double overhead camshafts that's\r\n8:09\r\nright your mom's minivan has single\r\n8:10\r\noverhead cams anyway the nsx's V6 also\r\n8:13\r\ngot titanium connecting rods to stay\r\n8:16\r\ntogether at an astronomical 8 000 RPM\r\n8:19\r\nunfortunately the big twin cam heads no\r\n8:22\r\nlonger fit in the car so Honda had to\r\n8:24\r\nredesign the entire body to fit it\r\n8:27\r\nstretching the wheelbase by over an inch\r\n8:29\r\nand it was definitely worth it\r\n8:32\r\nworth it less so for the 20 horsepower\r\n8:35\r\nas it was for the bragging rights of 8\r\n8:37\r\n000 RPM plus the acoustic impact of the\r\n8:41\r\ncam changeover this was America's first\r\n8:43\r\nappearance of VTEC and when that thing\r\n8:45\r\nswitched to the high lift cam lobes the\r\n8:48\r\nintake sang a song that had only ever\r\n8:50\r\nbeen sung in Italian\r\n8:57\r\nHonda's over Square V6 was a 90 degree\r\n8:59\r\nlayout which left lots of space for that\r\n9:01\r\ncool intake system but 90 degree v6s\r\n9:04\r\nusually require balance shafts and the\r\n9:07\r\nNSX didn't get them this gave the nsx's\r\n9:09\r\nmotor a characteristic shimmy at low\r\n9:11\r\nrevs though split crank pins gave it an\r\n9:14\r\neven firing order for maximum power\r\n9:17\r\n270 horsepower went a lot further than\r\n9:20\r\nyou'd think because the all-aluminum NSX\r\n9:22\r\nwas a true lightweight just a third of a\r\n9:24\r\ntank of gas away from being under 3 000\r\n9:27\r\npounds so light that the 5-speed models\r\n9:29\r\ndidn't have or really need power\r\n9:31\r\nsteering see\r\n9:34\r\n[Music]\r\n9:36\r\neasy so the NSX handily out accelerated\r\n9:39\r\nits competition it hit 60 miles an hour\r\n9:42\r\nin 5.2 and blew through the quarter at\r\n9:44\r\n13 8 beating the brand new Ferrari 348\r\n9:47\r\nby half a second or more in both\r\n9:49\r\nmeasures when the road turned it\r\n9:52\r\noutgripped lotuses and 911s and an\r\n9:55\r\noutbreaked everything\r\n9:58\r\nin those individual performance metrics\r\n10:00\r\nit's shown but put them all together in\r\n10:03\r\nterms of its total performance envelope\r\n10:05\r\nand the NSX was untouchable\r\n10:09\r\nit won just about every award it could\r\n10:11\r\nhere in America automobile the year Car\r\n10:13\r\nof the Year design of the Year there was\r\n10:15\r\na two-year waiting list people were\r\n10:17\r\npaying above sticker for it every single\r\n10:20\r\nroad test talked about it rendering\r\n10:21\r\nFerraris irrelevant flawed relics of the\r\n10:25\r\npast that had no future in the modern\r\n10:27\r\nworld the NSX was a phenomenon\r\n10:30\r\nphenomenon\r\n10:32\r\nand then it was just a non a non-starter\r\n10:37\r\na non-event a no-show on people's\r\n10:39\r\nshopping lists just a few years later\r\n10:41\r\nthe very car that every American Car\r\n10:44\r\nmagazine said would put Ferrari out of\r\n10:46\r\nbusiness\r\n10:47\r\nwas being outsold ten to one by a\r\n10:51\r\nFerrari\r\n10:53\r\nthe NSX remained in production for 15\r\n10:56\r\nyears but 60 percent of all nsx's\r\n11:00\r\nproduced were in the first two years the\r\n11:02\r\nplant was designed to spit out 25 cars a\r\n11:05\r\nday but by the end of year three was\r\n11:07\r\noperating at less than 10 percent of\r\n11:10\r\nthat capacity though the NSX is widely\r\n11:13\r\ncredited for forcing Ferrari to up its\r\n11:15\r\ngame the nsx's sales evaporated long\r\n11:18\r\nbefore Ferrari even had a chance to\r\n11:20\r\nrespond which of course they did\r\n11:22\r\nironically it might have been the nsx's\r\n11:24\r\ninherent goodness that was its biggest\r\n11:27\r\nflaw because to some it had committed\r\n11:29\r\nthe Cardinal Supercar sin the NSX was\r\n11:33\r\nboring\r\n11:34\r\nthis was by Design Honda's head of r d\r\n11:36\r\nquote studied what really made a sports\r\n11:39\r\ncar special and we reached the\r\n11:40\r\nconclusion that balance is the most\r\n11:42\r\nimportant thing huh\r\n11:45\r\nlook I was out of a Supercar as an\r\n11:48\r\nemotional thing not a cognitive one so\r\n11:50\r\nif we're going to examine the relative\r\n11:51\r\nsuccess of Ferrari versus Acura we're\r\n11:53\r\ngoing to now have to start a discussion\r\n11:55\r\nof the relative merits of sex appeal\r\n11:57\r\nversus intelligence\r\n12:00\r\nAustralia's Wheels magazine said quote\r\n12:02\r\nyou drive this one with brain and\r\n12:04\r\nfingertips with a Ferrari Lamborghini\r\n12:07\r\nit's bravado and biceps Car and Driver\r\n12:10\r\nsaid the NSX is quote a brain surgeon's\r\n12:13\r\napproach to go fast operations this is\r\n12:16\r\nthe age-old debate between brains and\r\n12:18\r\nbeauty and I have neither so I'm not\r\n12:20\r\nqualified to comment on that but one\r\n12:23\r\nperson is and that's the famed\r\n12:24\r\nAutomotive journalist Joan Rivers don't\r\n12:28\r\nyou think men really like intelligence\r\n12:30\r\nmore when it comes right down\r\n12:32\r\nhas ever put his hand up a woman's\r\n12:34\r\nbreast looking for a library card\r\n12:36\r\n[Applause]\r\n12:41\r\nthe NSX was a library card a rational\r\n12:45\r\nintelligent car problem was buyers\r\n12:48\r\nalready had one of those in sedan form\r\n12:50\r\nwith things like power steering and a\r\n12:52\r\nback seat turns out when they were\r\n12:54\r\nlooking for a Supercar all that mattered\r\n12:56\r\nwas a thrill\r\n12:58\r\neven though Karen driver was one of the\r\n13:00\r\nnsx's biggest fans it felt the need to\r\n13:03\r\ndefend its love for the car four years\r\n13:05\r\nafter its introduction\r\n13:06\r\nhad to admit that the NSX was quote\r\n13:08\r\nneither coveted nor respected in Fair\r\n13:11\r\nproportion to the Joy it delivers and\r\n13:14\r\nthen went on to Define joy as only an\r\n13:17\r\nengineer could\r\n13:18\r\n[Music]\r\n13:19\r\nthe great outward visibility there was\r\n13:22\r\n312 degrees of it in fact thanks to this\r\n13:24\r\nF-16 inspired canopy the NSX has ice\r\n13:28\r\ncold air conditioning a tilt and\r\n13:30\r\nTelescope steering wheel an easy shifter\r\n13:33\r\nhey we got 25.5 miles per gallon on a\r\n13:37\r\nhighway trip I'm not making this up good\r\n13:40\r\nElbow Room who cares the JD Power\r\n13:43\r\ninitial quality survey results show\r\n13:45\r\nfewer faults per 100 cars than a\r\n13:47\r\nMercedes-Benz\r\n13:51\r\nhuh\r\n13:53\r\nHonda had engineered a Ferrari for a\r\n13:56\r\ncord buyers who were importantly not\r\n13:59\r\nFerrari buyers yes the NSX was so good\r\n14:02\r\nthat it made Ferrari go back and put ice\r\n14:04\r\ncold functioning air conditioning in its\r\n14:06\r\ncars but ironically the NSX was far too\r\n14:09\r\ngood of a car to put Ferrari out in\r\n14:11\r\nbusiness so does that mean Honda made a\r\n14:14\r\nmistake well look the purpose of a car\r\n14:16\r\nis to sell and so it depends on where\r\n14:18\r\nyou draw the line on this side you have\r\n14:20\r\nthe first generation NSX which was maybe\r\n14:22\r\na failure to optimize for sales on the\r\n14:25\r\nother you have the second generation NSX\r\n14:28\r\nwhich was beyond question a mistake\r\n14:33\r\nthey screwed up it too won all kinds of\r\n14:36\r\nawards from magazines but it was nailed\r\n14:39\r\nto showroom floors meanwhile it's\r\n14:41\r\nunquestionably talented Engineers\r\n14:43\r\nboasted about how well its tires\r\n14:45\r\nperformed in cold Icy Ohio winter\r\n14:47\r\npuddles they were proud that it started\r\n14:50\r\nup quietly so as to not attract\r\n14:52\r\nattention in the church parking lot I'm\r\n14:55\r\nnot making this up it was another\r\n14:57\r\nrational left brain

legendary French brand Bugatti\r\n1:54\r\nstarted making cars in the early 1900s\r\n1:57\r\nand within no time it had racked up\r\n1:59\r\nliteral thousands of major race wins\r\n2:02\r\nBugatti was Untouchable atori Bugatti\r\n2:06\r\nbelieved that racing was a great way to\r\n2:08\r\nShowcase his car's abilities but he\r\n2:10\r\nwasn't a racer he was a\r\n2:13\r\nperfectionist and a half in fact had the\r\n2:17\r\nterm obsessive compulsive disorder\r\n2:19\r\nexisted while he was alive he would have\r\n2:22\r\ninsisted that it be renamed CDO because\r\n2:26\r\nCDO is OCD in alphabetical order\r\n2:30\r\nas it should\r\n2:31\r\nbe mure Bugatti's cars reflected mure\r\n2:35\r\nBugatti's CDO not only were the\r\n2:38\r\nengineering masterpieces but every\r\n2:40\r\nsingle part was a work of art from the\r\n2:42\r\nengine turned metal firewalls to the\r\n2:45\r\nperfectly crafted cam boxes the cars\r\n2:48\r\nweren't the only sculptures so too were\r\n2:51\r\nthe machines that made the cars many of\r\n2:54\r\nwhich were designed by Mur Bugatti as\r\n2:56\r\nwere most of the things in the factory\r\n2:59\r\nincluding the the silverware because\r\n3:01\r\nthose other people's implements were\r\n3:03\r\nnever good\r\n3:07\r\nenough Bugatti even made his own\r\n3:09\r\nelectricity to power the factory and the\r\n3:12\r\nelectric car he designed for himself\r\n3:14\r\nwhen the power company had the gall to\r\n3:16\r\ntell him he was late with a\r\n3:18\r\npayment you're getting the picture right\r\n3:20\r\nlet's just call a spade a spade the man\r\n3:22\r\nwas nuts or maybe he was just French\r\n3:25\r\nit's kind of hard to\r\n3:27\r\ntell actually he wasn't even in French\r\n3:30\r\nhe was just nuts atori was born to an\r\n3:32\r\nItalian family in Italy a fact that he\r\n3:35\r\nreferred to as quote that accident but\r\n3:37\r\nlittle did he know that 40 years after\r\n3:40\r\nhis death his company would be\r\n3:41\r\nresurrected in Italy and that script\r\n3:45\r\nstarted with a bit player named ferio\r\n3:47\r\nLamborghini perhaps you've heard of him\r\n3:49\r\nhe was mulling the idea of creating a\r\n3:51\r\nnew Italian Supercar about 10 years\r\n3:54\r\nafter he'd sold his own company together\r\n3:56\r\nwith a French writer and his old friend\r\n3:58\r\nthe engineer responsible for the Amura\r\n4:00\r\nand count they contemplated calling the\r\n4:02\r\nnew car company Furla or just ferio\r\n4:06\r\nsince ferio couldn't use the name\r\n4:09\r\nLamborghini things got serious when they\r\n4:11\r\nbrought in a bunch of Italian Supercar\r\n4:14\r\nSuperstars and then a man named Romano\r\n4:17\r\nartioli if that name sounds familiar\r\n4:20\r\nit's because he was The Man Behind the\r\n4:22\r\nLotus Elise but that hadn't quite\r\n4:24\r\nhappened yet at the time aroli was the\r\n4:26\r\nsouthern European distributor for Suzuki\r\n4:28\r\nand had the largest Ferrari dealership\r\n4:30\r\nin the world and he suggested that the\r\n4:32\r\nnew car be sold as a\r\n4:34\r\nBugatti fio eventually lost interest but\r\n4:37\r\nthrough equal parts luck charm and\r\n4:40\r\nslight of hand aroli managed to pry that\r\n4:43\r\nFrench national treasure away from\r\n4:45\r\nFrance and so suddenly Bugatti was back\r\n4:48\r\nand\r\n4:50\r\n[Music]\r\n4:54\r\nItalian and it was relocated to Cog\r\n4:57\r\ngalano a small town biking District from\r\n5:00\r\nFerrari Maserati and Lamborghini this\r\n5:02\r\nmeant artii had access to the dream team\r\n5:05\r\nof Engineers who had created every\r\n5:07\r\nposter worthy Italian Supercar of the\r\n5:10\r\nprevious 20\r\n5:12\r\nyears the Dream Team set out startup\r\n5:14\r\nstyle to build the best supercar in the\r\n5:16\r\nworld at the same time artioli spent\r\n5:19\r\nmore than $70 million building the best\r\n5:22\r\nBugatti Factory in the world even the\r\n5:25\r\nstorm drain grates had the EB logo on\r\n5:28\r\nthem and no this time they didn't build\r\n5:30\r\na new power plant to power the factory\r\n5:32\r\nbut the air conditioning was powered by\r\n5:34\r\nenergy recovered from the dinos when\r\n5:37\r\nbreaking in the V12 engines Bugatti\r\n5:40\r\nindeed and it gets better the ceiling\r\n5:43\r\ndesign of the Rotunda was inspired by\r\n5:45\r\nthe wheel of a Bugatti type 59 with\r\n5:48\r\nWindows to provide soft light for the\r\n5:50\r\ndesigner's drawing boards it then had\r\n5:53\r\nrows of electric lights that would\r\n5:54\r\nautomatically adjust to vary with the\r\n5:57\r\nintensity and path of the sunlight\r\n5:59\r\ncoming in through those windows the\r\n6:01\r\nfactory was so distracting to motorists\r\n6:03\r\non the highway next to it that the\r\n6:05\r\nroadway had to be artificially banked to\r\n6:07\r\nstop people from crashing while staring\r\n6:09\r\nat it on the day that would have been\r\n6:11\r\natori Bugatti's 109th birthday the new\r\n6:14\r\nFactory was inaugurated in a ceremony\r\n6:17\r\nthat genuinely could have won an Oscar\r\n6:19\r\nfor the most dramatic performance of the\r\n6:21\r\ncentury to symbolize the passing of the\r\n6:24\r\nflame between the old factory in mosheim\r\n6:26\r\nFrance and the new Factory in COG galano\r\n6:29\r\nItaly\r\n6:30\r\nBugatti decided to bypass the idea of a\r\n6:32\r\nsymbolic gesture and go straight for a\r\n6:35\r\nliteral\r\n6:38\r\none they had the youngest employee\r\n6:41\r\nworking at the mosheim factory light a\r\n6:43\r\nflame and place it into an ornate engine\r\n6:46\r\nturned case mounted to the front of a\r\n6:49\r\nBugatti galier together in a flotilla of\r\n6:52\r\n77 classic Bugattis that flame was\r\n6:55\r\ndriven to Cog galano 400 mil away where\r\n7:00\r\nthe youngest employee of the new Bugatti\r\n7:02\r\ncompany used it to light a torch at the\r\n7:05\r\nfactory which the Archbishop of Moda\r\n7:08\r\nthen\r\n7:19\r\nblessed this is the kind of high camp\r\n7:22\r\nover-the-top performance that could out\r\n7:25\r\ndrama an entire graduating class of\r\n7:28\r\ntheater Majors on Iowa WKA that was\r\n7:31\r\nlaced with MDMA and that was just the\r\n7:34\r\nfactory things get even more over the\r\n7:36\r\ntop when we're talking about the\r\n7:39\r\n[Music]\r\n7:42\r\ncar Bugatti decanted the used oil from\r\n7:46\r\nthe first EB 110 engines that ran into\r\n7:49\r\nlittle flasks resembling\r\n7:51\r\naaza and gave them out as gifts to\r\n7:54\r\nengineers and friends we're painting a\r\n7:57\r\npicture here folks\r\n8:03\r\nthe new Bugatti V12 wasn't just\r\n8:05\r\nassembled in kug galano it was created\r\n8:08\r\nthere even the block was cast inhouse\r\n8:11\r\nbecause that is how you build a Bugatti\r\n8:14\r\nengine the Bugatti V12 never needs a\r\n8:17\r\nbelt service because it has no timing\r\n8:19\r\nbelt it also has no timing chain its\r\n8:21\r\nfour cam shafts are gear driven\r\n8:23\r\nsomething you won't ever see outside of\r\n8:25\r\nracing it had 12 independent throttle\r\n8:28\r\nbodies feeding five valves per cylinder\r\n8:31\r\ndesign licensed from\r\n8:33\r\nYamaha it had an entirely conventional\r\n8:35\r\ncylinder bore of 81 mm but a piston\r\n8:38\r\nstroke of just\r\n8:41\r\n56.6 that's a shorter stroke than\r\n8:43\r\nFerrari's 1 and 1/2 L Formula 1 V12 and\r\n8:47\r\nlikely the shortest stroke of any\r\n8:50\r\nproduction car engine ever K cars\r\n8:53\r\nincluded and there was a cool reason for\r\n8:56\r\nit the engine and transmission were one\r\n8:58\r\nunit with the transmission main shaft in\r\n9:00\r\nthe center of the car in the same tiny\r\n9:03\r\nlittle case literally inches away from\r\n9:05\r\nand parallel to the engine's crankshaft\r\n9:08\r\na long stroke would have resulted in\r\n9:10\r\nlonger throws pushing the transmission\r\n9:12\r\nfurther away and locating the engine\r\n9:14\r\neven further off center to the left the\r\n9:17\r\ncompression ratio was an ultra low 7 1/2\r\n9:20\r\nto1 and combined with that tiny piston\r\n9:22\r\nstroke and just 3 and 1/2 L of\r\n9:25\r\ndisplacement this thing is absolutely\r\n9:27\r\npositively dead off boost but at 5,000\r\n9:31\r\nRPM when the Boost finally hits it turns\r\n9:34\r\ninto a monster and pulls all the way to\r\n9:36\r\nits 8600 RPM Redline in true drama form\r\n9:41\r\nIt's All or\r\n9:42\r\nNothing EB 110 GTS made\r\n9:46\r\n553 horsepower the later SS model made\r\n9:50\r\n603 and was enough piss and vinegar to\r\n9:53\r\nmake the ev10 the quickest and fastest\r\n9:55\r\ncar in the world a record that stood for\r\n9:58\r\nall of 3 months before it was beaten by\r\n10:02\r\nthe McLaren F1 but for its debut the\r\n10:05\r\nMcLaren F1 was unceremoniously plunked\r\n10:09\r\ndown in a drizzly parking lot in Monaco\r\n10:11\r\nwith a bunch of journalists asking\r\n10:12\r\nquestions when it came time to show the\r\n10:15\r\nnew Bugatti to the world artioli and\r\n10:17\r\nCompany put on a festival of thesbian\r\n10:21\r\nhistrionics so lavish that autocar\r\n10:23\r\nmagazine said it would have made a royal\r\n10:26\r\nevent at Windor castle look like a\r\n10:28\r\ngarden party but by comparison once\r\n10:30\r\nagain the date was chosen to celebrate\r\n10:32\r\natori Bugatti's birthday this time his\r\n10:35\r\n110th in case you're wondering where the\r\n10:37\r\nname EB 110 came from the two-day long\r\n10:42\r\nlaunch event kicked off at par LS with\r\n10:45\r\nmore than 5,000 invited guests to\r\n10:48\r\nwitness hours of speeches and of course\r\n10:51\r\na brunch there were 70 vintage Bugattis\r\n10:54\r\narranged in the Horseshoe shape of the\r\n10:56\r\nclassic Bugatti Grill any sort of\r\n10:58\r\ncommercial advertising was forbidden in\r\n11:00\r\nthe Esplanade but flowers were not so\r\n11:03\r\nArchi's wife who was responsible for an\r\n11:05\r\nentire line of Bugatti branded merch had\r\n11:08\r\na gargantuan floral arrangement made out\r\n11:11\r\nof roses in the shape of the Bugatti\r\n11:13\r\nlogo ha take that Gordon Murray with\r\n11:17\r\nyour piece of M McLaren F1 this is how\r\n11:20\r\nyou do a spectacle it was\r\n11:24\r\nabsolutely miserable according to Robert\r\n11:27\r\ncumberford from Automobile Magazine who\r\n11:28\r\nwas there and said the speeches were\r\n11:30\r\ninterminable and of no interest and\r\n11:33\r\nworse they were in French with no\r\n11:35\r\ninterpreters available but hey the whole\r\n11:37\r\nthing made for great publicity photos\r\n11:40\r\nespecially when it ended and the eb-10\r\n11:43\r\nwas joined by a 50 bike motorcade of\r\n11:45\r\npolice two prototypes and a sea of\r\n11:48\r\nvintage Bugattis all in the midst of a\r\n11:51\r\ncomplete Parisian traffic nightmare\r\n11:53\r\nfighting to get to the arct of and we're\r\n11:56\r\nnot even close to the end yet that\r\n11:58\r\nevening\r\n12:00\r\n1,700 people joined for a sitdown formal\r\n12:03\r\ndinner at The Chateau of versailes\r\n12:06\r\ndrinking Bugatti branded champagne while\r\n12:08\r\nsenori aroli and his wife danced the\r\n12:11\r\nfirst dance of the evening it was a\r\n12:13\r\nwaltz in case you wanted to know it was\r\n12:16\r\nlike an Indian Royal Wedding only far\r\n12:20\r\nmore\r\n12:21\r\nexpensive meanwhile the car was already\r\n12:24\r\nin a truck on its way to mosheim 300 M\r\n12:27\r\naway because the next morning on the\r\n12:29\r\nactual day of at tor's 110th birthday it\r\n12:32\r\nwould be put on display for the public\r\n12:34\r\nto see in town and then at the Chateau\r\n12:36\r\nSan the Small Castle that atori had used\r\n12:39\r\nto entertain his guests and to spy on\r\n12:42\r\ntheir table manners to decide whether\r\n12:43\r\nthey were worthy of his car don't worry\r\n12:47\r\nAri's Bugatti also had a selection\r\n12:49\r\ncommittee charged with doing the same\r\n12:51\r\nthough specifically they were weeding\r\n12:53\r\nout speculators and trying to make sure\r\n12:55\r\nthat real drivers bought the eb- 110 one\r\n12:58\r\nGerman made it through the screening\r\n13:00\r\nprocess his name was Michael schoemer\r\n13:02\r\nmaybe you've heard of him and he took\r\n13:04\r\nvery public delivery of his eb-10 SS but\r\n13:08\r\nthen very privately crashed it somehow\r\n13:11\r\nthat never made it into the newspapers\r\n13:13\r\nmust have been driver error we all know\r\n13:15\r\nthat man can't drive and besides nobody\r\n13:17\r\nelse complained about the eb-10 handling\r\n13:19\r\nin fact the SS made it around the\r\n13:21\r\nnurburg ring in 7 minutes and 47 seconds\r\n13:24\r\nthat's just a couple seconds slower than\r\n13:26\r\nthe Veyron managed 12 years later later\r\n13:30\r\nit pulled a world record. n9g on the\r\n13:33\r\nskid pad is tested by radent track and\r\n13:35\r\nits handling was universally praised\r\n13:37\r\nwith neutral Behavior under power\r\n13:39\r\nbecause unlike other period all-wheel\r\n13:41\r\ndrive systems it sent 73% of the power\r\n13:44\r\nto the back it rode better than any\r\n13:47\r\nother superar it had wonderfully\r\n13:49\r\ncommunicative steering it was a dynamic\r\n13:51\r\nMasterpiece perfect\r\n13:54\r\neven until you got\r\n13:58\r\nin\r\n14:00\r\nit is very 1990s in here and this is the\r\n14:03\r\npart of the program where we go from\r\n14:05\r\nComedy to\r\n14:08\r\ntragedy along the way though we need to\r\n14:10\r\nstop at irony Bugatti took the time to\r\n14:13\r\ncast the engine block in its own Factory\r\n14:15\r\nto say nothing of having its own logo on\r\n14:17\r\nthe porcelain dishes in the cafeteria\r\n14:19\r\nbecause nothing less would do for a car\r\n14:21\r\nwearing a Bugatti badge and yet sitting\r\n14:24\r\nhere in the expensive seat I am looking\r\n14:27\r\ndirectly at a nardy badge\r\n14:29\r\nand a Nakamichi badge and I spy 1970s\r\n14:33\r\nFiat group Dash vents that are not\r\n14:35\r\nfooling me with an EB logo on them to\r\n14:38\r\nsay nothing of the poltrona fra branding\r\n14:41\r\nright on the\r\n14:42\r\nseat then there were the BBS wheels an\r\n14:45\r\nexhaust Weber fuel injection there were\r\n14:48\r\nlogos everywhere look this isn't that\r\n14:50\r\nuncommon but the Bugatti was supposed to\r\n14:52\r\nbe different was there more marketing\r\n14:55\r\nhere than substance well there sure was\r\n14:58\r\na lot of substance this thing weighs\r\n15:00\r\njust under 4,000 lb and by the way it's\r\n15:03\r\nonly as long as a gr Corolla that's a\r\n15:06\r\nlot of weight today but back then this\r\n15:08\r\nwas an astronomically heavy car and\r\n15:11\r\ncertainly against atori Bugatti's Mantra\r\n15:14\r\nthat waight is the enemy which sounds\r\n15:17\r\nlike Lotus founder Colin Chapman whose\r\n15:20\r\nfamous formula for Success was simplify\r\n15:23\r\nand add lightness of course Romano ortii\r\n15:26\r\npurchased Lotus while he owned Bugatti\r\n15:29\r\nand he envisioned a worldwide network of\r\n15:30\r\nlotus Bugatti dealers a sports car\r\n15:32\r\nmanufacturer with those two Brands as\r\n15:35\r\nbookends the Lotus side worked out for a\r\n15:37\r\nwhile but Bugatti was in for a rough\r\n15:40\r\nride from the start the EB 110 was a\r\n15:43\r\nhell of an automobile but the theater\r\n15:45\r\nsurrounding the company just turned to\r\n15:47\r\ntragedy the likely culprit was really\r\n15:50\r\njust timing calendar not Cam that was\r\n15:52\r\ndone by gears don't forget perhaps aroli\r\n15:55\r\nshould have taken it as an omen that 5\r\n15:57\r\ndays after the form of Bugatti\r\n16:00\r\nautomobile SBA was Black Monday well\r\n16:03\r\nPanic is the only way to describe what\r\n16:05\r\nhappened on Wall Street today the\r\n16:07\r\nmassive stock market crash that led to a\r\n16:09\r\nworldwide recession the eb110 likely\r\n16:12\r\nwould have done a lot better if it was\r\n16:14\r\nan\r\n16:15\r\neb15 at tor's 110th birthday was just a\r\n16:18\r\nbad time to launch a new Supercar with a\r\n16:20\r\nworldwide recession that just destroyed\r\n16:23\r\nExotic Car Sales Bugatti wanted to sell\r\n16:25\r\n150 of these a year and yet wound up\r\n16:28\r\nproducing only about 115 over 3 years of\r\n16:32\r\nproduction however that explanation is\r\n16:35\r\nfar too rational for a melodrama like\r\n16:38\r\nthis artioli insists the company went\r\n16:41\r\nbust with a full book of orders because\r\n16:43\r\na certain competitor threatened\r\n16:45\r\nBugatti's suppliers to stop sending\r\n16:47\r\nparts and even paid off his employees to\r\n16:50\r\nmess up the cars if you ask others it's\r\n16:53\r\nbecause Bugatti didn't pay its bills\r\n16:55\r\nSuzuki probably had an inadvertent part\r\n16:57\r\nin the failure of Bugatti it cancelled\r\n17:00\r\nAri's distributorship as one of the\r\n17:02\r\nDream Team alleges

            Transcript = "0:08\r\nOnce upon a time, the entire world conspired to make  the perfect sedan. It was designed by an Italian  \r\n0:16\r\nwho was obsessed with safety. It was engineered  by Germans who were infatuated with fuel economy. \r\n0:23\r\nIt had a Le Mans-winning V-8, strangely because  the Japanese had just finally \"arrived\" in America... \r\n0:30\r\nand it was so fat it didn't fit down its own  production line. So it needed to be hand built \r\n0:36\r\nby rivals across town. It was the Mercedes-Benz 500E. And it is the world's most perfect sedan.\r\n0:54\r\nBy the mid-1970s, Mercedes had twice put an unconscionably large V-8 in its S-class.   \r\n1:01\r\nThe first was 6.3 liters of \"shut up, hippie!\"\r\n1:04\r\nThe second was a 6.9-liter middle finger issued right in the middle of a fuel crisis. And yet despite these childish acts of defiance, Mercedes' image remained  \r\n1:16\r\nold and stodgy.\r\n1:20\r\nIronically, that very fuel  crisis sent Mercedes into an existential tailspin that resulted in twins! The sub-compact  W201 and compact W124 sedans rescued Mercedes from  \r\n1:35\r\nthe past and catapulted it to defining the future of  the automobile. Thanks to looming U.S. fuel economy  \r\n1:39\r\nregulations, Mercedes threw its entire engineering  might behind its compact twins — which would also  \r\n1:45\r\nuse a new family of fuel efficient four-, five-, and six-cylinder engines. And then Mercedes found an  \r\n1:51\r\nItalian to make them look like the future. Bruno Sacco's design was revolutionary, though it may  \r\n1:58\r\nnot look it now, because every sedan since has  been modeled after these cars: integrated bumpers,  \r\n2:04\r\nflush headlights, tail lights on the body with a trunk opening that dipped below them. It also had  \r\n2:10\r\na wedge-shaped high trunklid for aerodynamics. And something else: its rear was tapered like a  \r\n2:16\r\nteardrop. It may look like an upright square box to the eye, but not to the air: with a coefficient of drag\r\n2:24\r\nas low as 0.26, the W124 is one of the  most aerodynamically efficient sedans of all time.\r\n2:33\r\nThis was designed in the 1970s! These cars looked like spaceships when they debuted  \r\n2:38\r\nbecause everything else on the road looked like this! Thing about Bruno Sacco is that he had just  \r\n2:45\r\ncome from Mercedes' safety department. So while his stated goal was to create a design that would stay  \r\n2:50\r\nrelevant for three decades, his actual target was at the confluence of design, efficiency, and safety.\r\n2:58\r\nSo, Sacco's cars included innovations like  the mesmerizing articulating single wiper.  \r\n3:04\r\nIt covered a record-breaking 86 percent of  the windshield, but its arm stayed parallel  \r\n3:09\r\nto the airflow at all times so the blade didn't  lift off the glass on the Autobahn.\r\n3:14\r\nAnd ribbed taillights designed so that they still transmit light when they're covered with snow or mud.   \r\n3:19\r\nAnd rear headrests that drop down at the press of a button so you didn't back over your neighbor's kid (by accident.)\r\n3:25\r\nBy the end of the 1980s, Mercedes  was basking in its huge success, with Yuppies  \r\n3:33\r\neverywhere fawning all over their expensive over-engineered status symbols. But with the new decade  \r\n3:40\r\ncame a new crisis, and its name was Lexus.\r\n3:43\r\nLexus stunned the world with a flagship that was, in almost all respects, better than the Mercedes S-Class — and it cost half as much!\r\n3:53\r\nLess, even, than the six-cylinder 300E! Poof! There went a quarter of  Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales, overnight!\r\n4:01\r\nA desperate plea came in from Mercedes North America:\r\n4:05\r\n[off screen] \"Hey Krauts! Throw a v8 in that thing or we're never going to be able to sell another one!\"\r\n4:09\r\nGood idea, but remember this was a fuel crisis vehicle: it was designed for skinny little four- five- and six-cylinder engines. And Mercedes' obsession with  \r\n4:16\r\nsafety meant the frame rails were placed close to  the center of the engine compartment to protect  \r\n4:21\r\nyou in an offset crash. Way ahead of its time, but a big, wide V-8 was never gonna fit. And with Mercedes  \r\n4:28\r\nengineers so busy trying to figure out how to beat  Lexus with the next S-Class, they just didn't have  \r\n4:33\r\nthe time to mess with the old 124. But you know who did? Porsche! Three things to remember:\r\n4:41\r\nPorsche and Mercedes are both headquartered in Stuttgart: they're like walking distance away from each other.\r\n4:47\r\nSee? Secondly Porsche was in huge trouble,  with U.S. sales down by almost 90 percent!\r\n4:55\r\nThey were desperate for money and work. And third, Porsche has an engineering consulting service.  \r\n5:01\r\nSo Mercedes walked right over and hired Porsche to  fit the new Mercedes V-8 into the 124.  \r\n5:09\r\nPorsche Engineering would be responsible for widening the front frame rails to make room;\r\n5:14\r\nreinforcing the firewall and structure to deal with the extra  power; moving the front seats further apart\r\n5:19\r\nto fit the exhaust down the new, wider transmission tunnel;  and then doing the side-impact crash testing.\r\n5:25\r\nMeanwhile, the new V-8, codenamed M119, had just made its production car debut in the 500SL...\r\n5:31\r\nand then immediately won the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 1989 Sauber C9 used a twin-turbo,\r\n5:39\r\n925-horsepower version of that engine, and it took first, second, and fifth places in that race!\r\n5:46\r\nMercedes tested the engines after the endurance  race and found out that not only did they make  \r\n5:51\r\nmore power after the race than they did before, they showed negligible wear. You can't make this  \r\n5:56\r\nstuff up. Anyway, the M119 came in two different sizes, and Mercedes realized that if they put  \r\n6:01\r\nshorter connecting rods in it, the 5.0-liter could be made to have the same external dimensions as  \r\n6:06\r\nthe 4.2 liter... Which meant that Porsche's engineering could be used for two models:  \r\n6:13\r\nThe first would be the 400E, designed for the American market to compete against another car  \r\n6:18\r\nwith 400 in its name: yeah, the Lexus LS400. The second model was aimed right at Munich, with the  \r\n6:25\r\nfull-fat 5-liter to banish the sport sedan that  had been giving Mercedes Autobahn Agita for years:  the BMW M5.\r\n6:32\r\nThis big-bore, short-stroke  all-aluminum V-8 is a masterpiece.  \r\n6:37\r\nThe block is decades old but the heads were all-new with 4 valves per cylinder, 4 camshafts, and variable valve timing.\r\n6:44\r\nIt made supercar power — but there was a problem. A big, fat problem.\r\n6:52\r\nTo complement all that power, Mercedes gave the 500E suspension, wheel, and brake components from  \r\n6:57\r\nthe heavier and wider (R129) SL. To fit that stuff, the 500E got 2.2 inches of delicious, gorgeous  \r\n7:05\r\nfinger-licking fender flares.\r\n7:07\r\nAnd now it was so fat it didn't fit down its own production line at the Mercedes plant!\r\n7:13\r\nOnce again, Porsche to the rescue! The  factory that had been building the 959 supercar was sitting empty,\r\n7:19\r\nand so Mercedes paid Porsche again — this time to build the 500E.\r\n7:25\r\nMercedes would ship over a 300E body-in-white, which Porsche would then modify to fit the V-8.\r\n7:30\r\nIt sent the reinforced body back over to Mercedes for paint.\r\n7:33\r\nIf it was to be a narrow-body 400E, it would continue down the production line at Mercedes.\r\n7:38\r\nIf it was to be a 500E, it would be trucked back to a different plant at Porsche along with a big box of parts.\r\n7:45\r\nThen, Porsche would assemble it all into a car and send it back to Mercedes again for final inspection and delivery.\r\n7:53\r\nThis absurd process took 18 days, and it is one of the reasons this  thing was so expensive.\r\n8:01\r\nIn 1992, it cost $89,000!\r\n8:04\r\nThat was 35% more than a BMW M5 — and in today's terms, that's nearly Bentley money. For a compact!\r\n8:14\r\nThe outrageously hot Audi RS2 wagon was built in  the same factory. Which meant for a short time, you  \r\n8:20\r\ncould actually see Mercedeses and Audises coming out of the same Porsche factory together. But while  \r\n8:26\r\nthe RS2 was genuinely a Porsche-Audi collaboration, the 500E... wasn't! Everyone wants to believe that the  \r\n8:34\r\n500E was a Porsche sports sedan but the only  Porsche part on it is the battery cover which  \r\n8:39\r\nhas a sticker on it from a supplier saying that  Porsche bought it from them. Look, Porsche did the  \r\n8:44\r\nengineering to bolt parts from one Mercedes model  onto another Mercedes model. Porsche didn't use any  \r\n8:51\r\nof its own parts, and from all I can tell, had no  hand in tuning any of them. But here's the thing:\r\n8:57\r\nMercedes didn't need any help.\r\n8:59\r\nJust about every  magazine article declared the 500E the best car in the world.\r\n9:04\r\n\"Automobile\" said it three times in one article.\r\n9:07\r\nCar and Driver had literally no complaints other than the price.\r\n9:10\r\nI agree. This is a car from  back when Mercedes engineers outranked Mercedes accountants.\r\n9:16\r\nAnd that means that a Mercedes would  be priced based on what it cost to engineer and then produce, not the other way around.\r\n9:24\r\nThat's why they say — and they really used to mean — that a Mercedes-Benz is engineered like no other car  in the world.\r\n9:31\r\nBecause it was.\r\n9:33\r\nIts recirculating-ball steering is more talkative than any modern  cars, Porsche and Ferrari included.\r\n9:38\r\nThe engine is a torquey, revvy, acoustical masterpiece. The structure feels as stiff as anything today. The interior is... perfect.\r\n9:49\r\nOkay, it's not perfect. It starts  out in second gear unless you boot it, \r\n9:53\r\nand then the traction control hates burnouts — but both of those things can be fixed. So effectively  \r\n9:58\r\nwhat we have here is the best compact sedan in the world, upgraded with four Recaro bucket seats,  \r\n10:03\r\nflared fenders, and a Le Mans-winning V-8 under its hood. But no Le Mans speeds because the 500E was  \r\n10:10\r\nelectronically limited to 156 mph as per  the gentleman's agreement between BMW and Mercedes.\r\n10:16\r\nI've heard people say all over the world this  car will do 178 mph if you just remove the limiter.  \r\n10:21\r\nNo. It would require hardware changes  for the 500E to go faster than 156 mph and that's because  \r\n10:28\r\nMercedes chose a final drive ratio such that  the engine is at its 6000-rpm redline when the \r\n10:34\r\ncar is at its 156-mph top speed. To go  any faster, you'd need longer gears. But by choosing  \r\n10:40\r\nthe short gear ratio it decimated fuel economy (ironic, given that the 124 was originally designed  \r\n10:46\r\nfor fuel economy) but it means that Mercedes never  sacrificed acceleration in the name of MPGs. And so,\r\n10:54\r\ndespite only four gears and a slushbox, the 500E hit 60 mph in five and a half seconds,  \r\n11:00\r\nblasted through the quarter mile at 101 mph, and left the E34 BMW M5 for dead\r\n11:07\r\n— and not just in a straight line! The Mercedes out-braked and out-cornered the M-Car, too.\r\n11:12\r\nThe 500E (and the E500, as it was badged in its final year) have gotten a lot more enthusiast attention than any of the  \r\n11:19\r\nbig-motor Benzes that came before it, and I don't think it's because it was touched by the hands  \r\n11:24\r\nof Porsche — so was the 400E, and you don't care  about that car! No, I think it's for three reasons:\r\n11:29\r\nNumber one: this is not a full-size luxury car. It's a compact car — it's the size of today's Honda Civic.\r\n11:36\r\nTwo: the 6.3 and 6.9 were basically cushy luxury sedans with a jet pack strapped to the back.  \r\n11:45\r\nThis was a comprehensive rethink of a luxury car with intergalactic power — that had handling to match.\r\n11:53\r\nAnd Three: the 500E is a W124, and the 124  has a well-earned reputation at being  \r\n11:59\r\nperhaps the best-engineered best-proportioned, best-designed, longest-lasting sedan of all time.\r\n12:05\r\nThey say, \"it takes a village,\" and in  the case of the 500E, it took Mercedes brain power, \r\n12:11\r\nItalian design, American fuel economy regs, Japanese competition, and then Porsche's engineering.\r\n12:18\r\nSo, it took more than just a village: it  took half the world — including two car  \r\n12:23\r\ncompanies that were in the same village. But all  of those forces came together to create what was  \r\n12:28\r\ncertainly then, and probably still is  today, the world's most perfect sedan.\r\n13:40\r\nokay so you're just gonna keep the ferrari  framed out the entire time right yep okay  \r\n13:44\r\naction i'm not some rich youtuber asking you to  like and subscribe hey keep the ferrari out i'm  \r\n13:52\r\nan automotive journalist asking you to like and  subscribe and that's because that's how youtube  \r\n13:56\r\nworks if you don't click those buttons youtube  doesn't know you liked what you've just seen and  \r\n14:00\r\nisn't going to show you any more of it and if  you don't like what you've just seen well join  \r\n14:04\r\nthe club and by that i mean the hagerty drivers  club which gets you access to this award-winning  \r\n14:09\r\nmagazine as well as discounts on amazing stuff and  if if you still don't like what you've seen well  \r\n14:16\r\nthen just leave a nasty comment because that's  how the internet works i need to go clean that up"
